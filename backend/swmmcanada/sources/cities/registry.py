"""City registry — the ONE place a real-network city is wired into the pipeline.

Each entry is a ``CitySpec``: coverage bbox (how the AOI dispatcher picks the city), the
city's metric CRS, and three callables that hide the adapter's fetch/build composition
(some builders take the fetch dict whole, others unpack it — that variance stays here).
Adding city #9 = write its adapter module + append ONE spec below; ``pipeline.py`` is
untouched (ADR 0006's "a new city is mostly a thin field mapping", now enforced).
