"""City of Calgary storm-sewer open data -> SWMM ``NetworkIn`` (geometry-inferred topology).

Calgary publishes inverts (UP_INVERT/DN_INVERT, m AMSL), HEIGHT/WIDTH (mm; equal -> circular
diameter), MATERIAL, LENGTH and SLOPE on its STORM_PIPE layer, but **no node ids** — so, like
Ottawa, topology is inferred from pipe polyline endpoints by ``cities.base`` (coordinate
snapping at ~1 m). Outfalls come from the Inlet/Outfall layer: a feature is an outfall when its
``OUT_INLET`` names a receiving water body (e.g. "BOW RIVER") — non-null and not the literal
'UNKNOWN' (OPEN ENDED STUBs, excluded since the 2026-07-14 audit) — or its ``S_FUNCTION``
contains "OUTFALL"; inlets have a null ``OUT_INLET``.

Unlike Ottawa, Calgary DOES publish polygon parcels and buildings, so ``fetch_calgary_land``
returns them for the ADR 0005 parcel/building subcatchment method:
  * parcels   = ``Parcel_with_Roll_2026`` (ROLL_CPID_2026, full-coverage parcel polygons;
                NOT ``Parcel_Assessment``, which is a polyline display layer);
  * buildings = ``Buildings_from_Digital_Aerial_Survey`` (DAS_BUILDING polygons).

The hosted FeatureServer serves real GeoJSON for ``f=geojson`` (geometry populated), so we fetch
with ``f=geojson`` directly; ``base.esri_to_geojson`` is still applied defensively for any layer
that falls back to Esri JSON (``attributes``/``paths`` shaped) so the adapter is robust either way.
All endpoints verified live 2026-06-22 (see ``tests/fixtures/calgary/README.md``).
