"""City of Regina storm-sewer open data -> SWMM ``NetworkIn`` (geometry-inferred topology).

Regina (opengis.regina.ca, catalogued at open.regina.ca) publishes invert elevations
(STARTELEVATION/ENDELEVATION, doubles, m AMSL ~570+), DIAMETER (integer, mm), MATERIAL and
SURVEYLENGTH (m) on its Storm Sewer Line layer, but **no node ids** — so, like Ottawa/Kelowna,
topology is inferred from pipe polyline endpoints by ``cities.base`` (coordinate snapping at
~1 m). Only ``STATUS = 'ACTIVE'`` lines that are not force mains are fetched: ABANDONED /
CUT OFF / NOT IN USE lines and the pressurized ``Force`` subtype are not part of the gravity
storm graph (Main/Trunk/Drain/Culvert/RetentionTank are). Outfalls come from the Outfall point
layer (455 city-wide, along Wascana Creek and the storm channels).

Regina DOES publish parcels (the ``Parcels`` service's ASSESSMENT_REGIONS layer is lot-level
assessment parcels — ~73k polygons with ACCOUNT_NUMBER/APN) and a BUILDING FOOTPRINT polygon
layer, so subcatchment delineation can use real lot lines + roofs (ADR 0005). Catch basins
(layer 3, with RIMELEVATION/SUMPELEVATION) seed the subcatchments.

The city's own ArcGIS Server (10.91) serves real geometry for ``f=geojson`` and supports
pagination (maxRecordCount 1000). All endpoints verified live 2026-07-02 (see
``tests/fixtures/regina/README.md``).
